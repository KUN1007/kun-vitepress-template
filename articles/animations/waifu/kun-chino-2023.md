# Happy Birthday—Do You Know How Adorable Chino Is!!!

## Summary

<br>

Chino has grown up over three years, and I have grown up over nine years!!! This is the happiness of growing up together with Chino!!!

From her initially expressionless face (she actually did have expressions) to now her flower-like smile, this is the gift of time that has brought Chino's growth!!!

Playing with friends, even the cool Chino is very cute!!! Chino-Maya-Megu team! Move out!!!

From the near-decade-old image quality to the new and fresh quality, Chino looks more vivid to me now!!! And still as cute as ever!!!

If life deceives you, don't be sad, don't be impatient, may I offer you some rabbit today!!!

Even though I discovered Chino's cuteness many years ago, my love for her hasn't diminished one bit!!! This is simply heaven's gift of cuteness!!

Chino!!! The pinnacle of life!!! The definition of moe!!! The symbol of a small, adorable, soft, moe girl!!!

After all these years, I've come to a conclusion: there is no one in the world who doesn't like Chino!! No one!!! Because Chino is just that cute!!!

## So! What exactly makes Chino so adorable!

<br>

Is it her water-blue long hair + white short socks + blue little shoes that give her a ladylike demeanor?

Is it Tippy on her head?

Is it the occasional feeling she gives of a small animal?

Is it the fact that even though she's small, she exudes a mature aura?

Is it her ability to create coffee art like Picasso at such a young age?

Is it her love for playing with small objects like ships in bottles?

Is it her cute sleeping face?

Is it the occasional adorable expression when she's proud?

Yes!!!!!!!! These are all Chino's moe points!!!!!!!!!!

But!!! This is not all!!!!

## What I want to say is!!! In short, it's extremely cute!!!!!!!!

So I want to fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love!!! Why can't I fall in love with Chino? Why isn't there a Chino route?!?!?!?

Ahem, actually, the above is not the main point.

The main point is! Today is Chino's birthday again!!
